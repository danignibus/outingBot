# Backend for Outing Buddy

-Backend functionality for Outing Buddy thesis. API currently includes signup, signin, and generated outings (protected by authentication).
-Server.js includes the functionality from our initial rudimentary SMS bot, which we used in an initial study to gather data for our thesis. The bot prompted users for entries of their best, most recent experiences every three days, and also responded to user's requests for various outings around the area.
